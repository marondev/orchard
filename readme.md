# Front-end Test

UI Link: [https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/N312IJ0C8GMK#/screens]

I used Tailwind with Gulp to create this test.

Hero Component
- I use grid to set and reorder the image section and content area
- I reorder the images and content on mobile as the content is more important.

Latest Component
- I use flex on this section to evenly separate the items
- I use line-clamp to the content to force to have only 3 lines

- All images can be preview in a modal.

## Quick Start

Install dev dependencies

```sh
yarn install // or npm install
```

Start development server with live preview

```sh
yarn dev // or npm run dev
```

Generate build files for production server

```sh
yarn prod // or npm run prod
```

All dev files are present in `src` folder. The build version can be found in `build` folder after running `yarn build` command.
